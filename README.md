# Chess Game in C++

This is a simple console-based chess game implemented in C++. The game allows two players to play chess against each other, implementing the basic rules of the game. The project covers various chess functionalities, including moves for each piece, en passant, castling, and check/checkmate detection. The game is designed to be run in a terminal/command prompt window.

# Features
Basic Chess Rules: All standard chess pieces (King, Queen, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Pawn) with their movement rules.
Piece Movement: Players can move pieces using a coordinate-based system (e.g., x1y1 to x2y2 format).
Check and Checkmate: The game checks if the King is in check and ends the game when checkmate occurs.
Castling: The ability to perform castling with both the King and Rook.
En Passant: Implemented en passant rule for pawns.
Alternating Turns: The game alternates turns between White and Black players.
Code Structure:
Square Class: Represents each square on the chessboard. It keeps track of the piece on the square and its color.
Piece Class: Defines the different chess pieces (King, Queen, Rook, Knight, Bishop, and Pawn).
Board Class: Manages the 8x8 chessboard, including piece placements and game rules such as check/checkmate detection, move validation, and rendering the board.
Gameplay: The game alternates turns between the two players (White and Black). It checks for valid moves and ensures the rules are followed (e.g., preventing moves that put the player's own King in check).
Colors and Formatting: Uses ANSI escape codes to display colored pieces and messages in the terminal for a better user experience.
Gameplay:
The user is prompted to enter a move as four digits representing the starting and ending positions on the chessboard (e.g., "0123" for moving a piece from (0, 1) to (2, 3)).

# Example Game Flow:
The board is displayed with the pieces represented as "K" (King), "Q" (Queen), "R" (Rook), "N" (Knight), "B" (Bishop), and "P" (Pawn).
Players alternate turns, moving their pieces by entering coordinates.
The game ends if one player's king is in checkmate, or the game is won by a player putting the opponentâ€™s king in check.

# How to Play:
